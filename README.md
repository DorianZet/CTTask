<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
 

Connecting to the GitHub API, the app shows a collection view of repos that match the user's query. When tapping a repo cell, the user is taken to a detail view controller, where they can find the info about the repo's:
- author (name and avatar image)
- stargazers count
- 3 last commits and their authors.

From this screen, the user can also go straight to the repo's GitHub webpage via Safari app extension and also is able to share the repo's name and url.
